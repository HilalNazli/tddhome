# tddhome - home for quick-start TDD sessions

This repository contains bare-minimum projects for several language / testing frameworks, like Java/JUnit, Python/pytest, etc.

## How quick-start do you mean

It depends, but on my laptop (plugged in to power), time to run first failing test looks like below:

- Java1.8 / JUnit5 / Intellij IDEA - 1 min. 40 sec.
- JavaScript / QUnit - 22 sec.
- Python 3 / pytest - 15 sec.
- JavaScript / mocha - N/A
